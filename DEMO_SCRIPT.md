## 🤔 Q&A Preparation

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: "How does this compare to create-react-app or similar tools?"**
A: "Those tools scaffold basic frontend apps. GenAppXpress scaffolds complete AI applications with backend APIs, vector databases, authentication, and deployment configs. It's like having a senior architect design your entire stack."

**Q: "What if I need to customize the generated code?"**
A: "That's the beauty - it generates clean, readable code with clear separation of concerns. You can modify anything. It's a starting point, not a black box."

**Q: "How do you keep up with rapidly changing AI technologies?"**
A: "Our template system is modular and regularly updated. New vector databases, AI frameworks, and best practices are continuously integrated."

**Q: "What about vendor lock-in?"**
A: "Zero lock-in. We generate standard code using popular open-source libraries. You own everything that's generated."

**Q: "Can this work with our existing development workflow?"**
A: "Absolutely. Generated projects include git initialization, CI/CD configs, and follow standard project structures that integrate with any workflow."

**Q: "What about security and compliance?"**
A: "Generated applications include security best practices - input validation, environment variable management, CORS configuration, and authentication templates."
